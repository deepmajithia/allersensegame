## Next Steps
1. Test the basic game structure and ensure all files are properly linked
2. Implement core game mechanics (movement, mowing, allergens)
3. Fix critical issues (controls, visibility, timer, minimap)
4. Enhance visual and audio elements
5. Implement gameplay progression
6. Test and optimize game performance
7. Prepare for final deployment
